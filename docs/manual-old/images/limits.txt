High Level = -11
Low Level = -16
Hysteresis = 2

When temperature is higher than high alarm level TurnOn events 
will be sent. When temperature lowers to high level set point 
minus hysteresis, which in this case is set to two, TurnOn events
will not be sent.

When temperature goes below -16 degrees TurnOff events will
be sent until it goes below set point + 2 degrees.
