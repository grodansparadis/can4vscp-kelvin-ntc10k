====== Registers ======

All VSCP modules have a set of 8-bit registers defined to export it's functionality in a common way. Some of them (register 128-255) are predefined and the information in them are the same for all VSCP modules. See the [[http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=register_abstraction_model|VSCP specification]] for a description of their content. 

The lower 128 register space is used for module specific registers. It is also here you find registers with which you configure your module. Also registers where you typically can read status information such as measurement data from the module is here.

The lower register space is further expanded in register pages.

Below is a description of the registers of the Kelvin NTC10KA module.

===== Module zone registers =====

^ Register ^ Page ^ Description ^
|  0  |  0  | The zone this module belongs to. |
|  1  |  0  | The sub zone this module belongs to. |

===== Sensor Control Registers =====

Configure which data is reported here and how it is reported.

==== Description of control register bits ====

^ Bit ^ Description ^
|  0,1  | Temperature unit \\ \\ **00** - Kelvin. \\ **01** - Celsius (default). \\  **10** - Fahrenheit. \\ **11** - Reserved. |
|  2  | Reserved. |
|  3  | Enable low alarm if set to one. |
|  4  | Enable high alarm if set to one. |
|  5  | Send **TurnOn/TurnOff** events instead of Alarm if set to one. |
|  6  | Controls when **TurnOn/TurnOff** events will be sent if activated. \\ \\ 0 - **TurnOn** event is sent when low temperature is reached as set in low temperature alarm register (see [sub:Low-alarm-registers]). **TurnOff** event is sent when high temperature is reached as set in high temperature alarm register (see [sub:High-alarm-registers]).\\ \\ 1 - **TurnOff** event is sent when low temperature is reached as set in low temperature alarm register (see [[[registers|Registers]]]). **TurnOn** event is sent when high temperature is reached as set in high temperature alarm register (see [sub:High-alarm-registers]). \\ \\ The hysteresis value (see [sub:Sensor-hysteresis-registers]) will effect **TurnOn/TurnOff** events The temperature must go above or below the hysteresis value before a new event will be sent out. |
|  7  | If this bit is set Alarm events will be sent continuous with a one second interval until the alarm register is read or the temperature goes to a non alarm state (with hysteresis taken into account see [[sub:Low-temperature-alarm]). **TurnOn/TurnOff** events will not be affected by a cleared alarm register and will be sent until this bit is cleared or the temperature goes to a non alarm state (with hysteresis taken into account. |

===== Voltage calibration registers =====

The Voltage used to calculate the temperature for a sensor have effect on the error. The voltage is theoretically 5V but will in reality be something else but still close to 5V. These register can be used to set a calibrated voltage obtained from actual measurements. The value stored in the two registers is the voltage times 10000 so 5V for example should be stored as 50000.

^ Register ^ Page ^ Description ^
|  118  |  0  | MSB of Voltage (Default is 0xC3). |
|  119  |  0  | MSB of Voltage (Default is 0x50). |

===== Raw A/D values =====

Raw A/D values from the temperature sensor network can be read if a user wants to. This can be useful for special nonstandard setups. The A/D converter is a 10-bit converter so the value can be 0-1023 and is stored MSB first in the registers (not in the converter) as all values are stored in VSCP. The registers can only be read, a write is ignored.

^ Register ^ Page ^ Description ^
|  72  |  1  | MSB of A/D converter value for sensor 0. |
|  73  |  1  | LSB of A/D converter value for sensor 0. |
|  74  |  1  | MSB of A/D converter value for sensor 1. |
|  75  |  1  | LSB of A/D converter value for sensor 1. |
|  76  |  1  | MSB of A/D converter value for sensor 2. |
|  77  |  1  | LSB of A/D converter value for sensor 2. |
|  78  |  1  | MSB of A/D converter value for sensor 3. |
|  79  |  1  | LSB of A/D converter value for sensor 3. |
|  80  |  1  | MSB of A/D converter value for sensor 4. |
|  81  |  1  | LSB of A/D converter value for sensor 4. |
|  82  |  1  | MSB of A/D converter value for sensor 5. |
|  83  |  1  | LSB of A/D converter value for sensor 5. |

===== Sensor calibration registers ===== 

The value in the calibration register is added to the measured sensor value before it's reported. The calibration value is stored as a two's complement temperature * 100 to allow for both positive and negative numbers. So 24.23 degrees is stored as 2423 and so on. This means that 100 will add one degree to the measured value while 65436 (0xFF9c) is -100 and will subtract one degree form the measured value. If you are unsecyre on how two complement umbers work there is an introduction here https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html
